From an application perspective, flow control is established once application data flow modeling has been completed. Data flow modeling can be described as the process of identifying, modeling, and documenting how data moves around an information system. Data flow modeling examines processes (activities that transform data from one form to another), data stores (the holding areas for data), external entities (what sends data into a system or receives data from a system), and data flows (routes by which data can flow).

Once the application data flows have been identified, corresponding flow controls can be applied at the appropriate points.

A few examples of flow control restrictions include the following: keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet and blocking information that is marked as classified but is being transported to an unapproved destination. Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path.

Application-specific examples of flow control enforcement can be found in information protection software (e.g., guards, proxies, gateways, and cross domain solutions) employing rule sets or establishing configuration settings restricting information system services or providing message-filtering capability based on content (e.g., using key word searches or document characteristics).

Applications providing information flow control must be able to enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information between interconnected systems in accordance with applicable policy.

Mobile code technologies include, for example, Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, PDF, Postscript, Shockwave movies, Flash animations, and VBScript. Usage restrictions and implementation guidance apply to both the selection and use of mobile code installed on organizational servers and mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations.

Applications can prevent the execution of prohibited mobile code by leveraging architectures that provide a virtual execution environment sometimes referred to as a &quot;sandbox&quot;. The mobile code is executed within this isolated environment apart from the host&#x27;s indigenous operating environment that allows for mobile code capability restrictions and helps to prevent malicious code from accessing system resources and data.

Policy and procedures related to mobile code address preventing the introduction of unacceptable mobile code within the information system. The DoDI 8552.01 policy pertains to the use of mobile code technologies within DoD information systems.

The application must prevent the execution of prohibited mobile code.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 font-medium text-zinc-900 whitespace-nowrap dark:text-white"><a class="flex flex-col" href="/stigs/Microsoft_SharePoint_Server_2013/groups/V-223252">V-223252</a></td><td class="px-6 py-4 text-center"><span class="text-sm font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-red-100 text-red-800 dark:bg-red-900 dark:text-red-300">high</span></td><td class="px-6 py-4">SharePoint must implement required cryptographic protections using cryptographic modules complying with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.</td><td class="px-6 py-4 whitespace-pre-line">Certain encryption types are no longer considered secure.

Session IDs are tokens generated by web applications to uniquely identify an application user&#x27;s session.  Applications will make application decisions and execute business logic based on the session ID. Unique session identifiers or IDs are the opposite of sequentially generated session IDs that can be easily guessed by an attacker. Unique session IDs help to reduce predictability of said identifiers. Unique session IDs address man-in-the-middle attacks, including session hijacking or insertion of false information into a session. If the attacker is unable to identify or guess the session information related to pending application traffic, they will have more difficulty in hijacking the session or otherwise manipulating valid sessions. When a user logs off, or when any other session termination event occurs, the application must terminate the user session to minimize the potential for an attacker to hijack that particular user session.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 font-medium text-zinc-900 whitespace-nowrap dark:text-white"><a class="flex flex-col" href="/stigs/Microsoft_SharePoint_Server_2013/groups/V-223259">V-223259</a></td><td class="px-6 py-4 text-center"><span class="text-sm font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-red-100 text-red-800 dark:bg-red-900 dark:text-red-300">high</span></td><td class="px-6 py-4">SharePoint must maintain the confidentiality of information during aggregation, packaging, and transformation in preparation for transmission.

One example includes marking data as classified or FOUO.

Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

Remote network and system access is accomplished by leveraging common communication protocols to establish a remote connection. These connections will typically originate over either the public Internet or the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Neither of these Internetworking mechanisms is private or secure, and they do not, by default, restrict access to networked resources once connectivity is established.

Numerous best practices are employed to protect remote connections, such as utilizing encryption to protect data sessions and firewalls to restrict and control network connectivity. In addition to these protections, auditing must also be utilized in order to track system activity, assist in diagnosing system issues and provide evidence needed for forensic investigations post security incident.

When organizations define security-related application functions or security-related application information, it is incumbent upon the application providing access to that data to ensure auditing of remote connectivity to those resources occurs in support of organizational requirements.

Remote access to security functions (e.g., user management, audit log management, etc.) and security-relevant information requires the activity be audited by the organization. Any application providing remote access must support organizational requirements to audit access or organization-defined security functions and security-relevant information.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 font-medium text-zinc-900 whitespace-nowrap dark:text-white"><a class="flex flex-col" href="/stigs/Microsoft_SharePoint_Server_2013/groups/V-223244">V-223244</a></td><td class="px-6 py-4 text-center"><span class="text-sm font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300">medium</span></td><td class="px-6 py-4">SharePoint must identify data type, specification, and usage when transferring information between different security domains so policy restrictions may be applied.</td><td class="px-6 py-4 whitespace-pre-line">Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information.

An example of flow control restrictions includes the following: keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet. Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., users, networks, devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems.

Application-specific examples of flow control enforcement can be found in information protection software (e.g., guards, proxies, application layer gateways, and cross domain solutions) employing rule sets or establishing configuration settings restricting information system services or providing message-filtering capability based on content (e.g., using key word searches or document characteristics).

Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Applications providing flow control must identify data type, specification, and usage when transferring information between different security domains so policy restrictions may be applied.

A security domain is defined as a domain implementing a security policy and administered by a single authority.

Data type, specification, and usage includes using file naming to reflect the type of data being transferred and limiting data transfer based on file type.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 font-medium text-zinc-900 whitespace-nowrap dark:text-white"><a class="flex flex-col" href="/stigs/Microsoft_SharePoint_Server_2013/groups/V-223245">V-223245</a></td><td class="px-6 py-4 text-center"><span class="text-sm font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300">medium</span></td><td class="px-6 py-4">SharePoint must provide the ability to prohibit the transfer of unsanctioned information in accordance with security policy.</td><td class="px-6 py-4 whitespace-pre-line">The application enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems in accordance with applicable policy.

It serves to eliminate or reduce the possibility that a single user may carry out a prohibited action. Separation of duties requires the person accountable for approving an action not be the same person who is tasked with implementing the action. 

This requirement is intended to limit exposure due to user accounts being used to operate from within a privileged account or role. Limiting the access and permissions of privileged accounts to the minimum required, reduces exposure if the account is compromised and provides forensic history of activity when operating from these accounts. 
This policy limits the Farm Account privileges in AD.  However, default permissions for this account are configured by the SharePoint Products Configuration Wizard during product installation. This account is referred to during the installation as the “Database Access” account. By default, the account is used as the service account for the SharePoint Timer Service and the SharePoint Central Administration Web Site Application Pool. These settings should not be changed. Furthermore, this account should not be used as the service account for non-privileged services, applications, or application pools.</td></tr><tr class="odd:bg-white odd:dark:bg-zinc-900 even:bg-zinc-50 even:dark:bg-zinc-800 border-b dark:border-zinc-700 border-zinc-200"><td scope="row" class="px-6 py-4 font-medium text-zinc-900 whitespace-nowrap dark:text-white"><a class="flex flex-col" href="/stigs/Microsoft_SharePoint_Server_2013/groups/V-223277">V-223277</a></td><td class="px-6 py-4 text-center"><span class="text-sm font-medium me-2 px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-sm bg-orange-100 text-orange-800 dark:bg-orange-900 dark:text-orange-300">medium</span></td><td class="px-6 py-4">SharePoint must validate the integrity of security attributes exchanged between systems.</td><td class="px-6 py-4 whitespace-pre-line">When data is exchanged between information systems, the security attributes associated with said data need to be maintained.
