If an attacker compromises an account, the entire MDM server infrastructure is at risk.

These objectives are best achieved by configuring the MDM server to leverage an enterprise authentication mechanism (e.g., Microsoft Active Directory Kerberos). \n\nTo ensure individual accountability and prevent unauthorized access, application users must be individually identified and authenticated. Individual accountability mandates that each user is uniquely identified. A group authenticator is a shared account or some other form of authentication that allows multiple unique individuals to access the application using a single account. If an application allows or provides for group authenticators, it must first individually authenticate users prior to implementing group authenticator functionality.
