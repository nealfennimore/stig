To meet this requirement, the information system must create trusted channels between itself and remote trusted authorized IT product (e.g., syslog server) entities that protect the confidentiality and integrity of communications. The information system must create trusted paths between itself and remote administrators and users that protect the confidentiality and integrity of communications.\n\nA trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is most often used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC. However, applications that do not use a trusted path are not approved for nonlocal and remote management of DOD information systems.\n\nUse of SSHv2 to establish a trusted channel is approved. Use of FTP, TELNET, HTTP, and SNMPV1 is not approved since they violate the trusted channel rule set. Use of web management tools that are not validated by common criteria may also violate the trusted channel rule set.\n\nWhen there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.\n\nThis requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted.

Click \"Create CSR\". Export the CSR and import it into the DOD site's Registration Authority (RA). Ensure that Subject Alternative Names (SANs) are created for all FQDNs, server names, and cluster names on the web enrollment form.\n5. Once the certificate is approved, download it and import it in this same section of the ICS.\n\nIn the Ivanti ICS Web UI, navigate to Authentication >> Auth Servers\n1. Click \"New Servers\". Under \"server type\", select Certificate Server >> New Server.\n2. Type a Name. Under User Name template type this exactly: <certAttr.altname.UPN>\n3. Click \"Save Changes\".\n4. Navigate to Authentication >> Auth Servers.\n5. Click \"New Servers\". Under \"server type\", select LDAP Server >> New Server.\n6. Type a name for the primary LDAP server domain.\n7. LDAP server: the FQDN of the server (an IP address may cause an error as the LDAP server certificate might not have an IP in the SAN field).\n8. LDAP port: 636 (this is for LDAPS).\n9. Backup LDAP Server1: the FQDN of the secondary server (an IP address may cause an error as the LDAP server certificate might not have an IP in the SAN field).\n10. Backup LDAP Port1: 636.\n11. If a third LDAP server is needed, add this and the port info under Backup LDAP Server2 and Backup LDAP Port2.\n12. LDAP Server Type: Active Directory.\n13. Connection: LDAPS.\n14. Ensure Validate Server Certificate is checked.\n15. Connection Timeout: 15.\n16. Search Timeout: 60.\n17. Scroll down to the bottom and click \"Save Changes\". Click \"Test Settings\" to ensure valid communications are possible.\nNOTE: If there are failures in this testing ensure that the step for Device Certificates and Trusted Server CAs were completed, as this will cause LDAPS certificate issues.\n18. Under authentication required, click the box for \"Authentication required\" to search LDAP.\n19. Enter the service account's Admin DN using this as an example format: CN=PCS.SVC,OU=IVANTI,DC=DOD,DC=mil\n20. Enter the service account's password.\n21. Under \"Finding user entries\", add the base DN of the domain as an example format: DC=DOD,DC=mil\n22. Under \"filter\", use this specific attribute configuration: userPrincipalName=<USER>\n23. Under \"group membership\", add the base DN of where admin users that will access, using this as an example format: OU=IVANTI,DC=DOD,DC=mil\n24. Under \"filter\", use the following: cn=<GROUPNAME>\n25. Under \"member attribute\", use the following: member\n26. Click Save \"Changes\".\n27. Now back in the same LDAP server configuration screen, scroll down and click the \"Server Catalog\" hyperlink.\n28. Under \"attributes\", click \"New\", Type: userPrincipalName, and click \"Save Changes\".\n29. Under \"groups\", click \"Search\". In the search box, type the group name used for admin logins.\n30.

          "description": "<VulnDiscussion>Without device-to-device authentication, communications with malicious devices may be established. Bidirectional authentication provides stronger safeguards to validate the identity of other devices for connections that are of greater risk.\n\nSNMPv3 supports authentication, authorization, access control, and privacy, while previous versions of the protocol contained well-known security weaknesses, which were easily exploited. SNMPv3 can be configured for identification and bidirectional, cryptographically based authentication.\n\nA typical SNMP implementation includes three components: managed device, SNMP agent, and NMS. The SNMP agent is the SNMP process that resides on the managed device and communicates with the network management system. The NMS is a combination of hardware and software that is used to monitor and administer a network. The SNMP data is stored in a highly structured, hierarchical format known as a management information base (MIB). The SNMP manager collects information about network connectivity, activity, and events by polling managed devices.\n\nSNMPv3 defines a user-based security model (USM), and a view-based access control model (VACM). SNMPv3 USM provides data integrity, data origin authentication, message replay protection, and protection against disclosure of the message payload. SNMPv3 VACM provides access control to determine whether a specific type of access (read or write) to the management information is allowed. Implement both VACM and USM for full protection.\n\nSNMPv3 server services must not be configured on products whose primary purpose is not to provide SNMP services. SNMP client services may be configured on the VPN gateway, application, or operating system to allow limited monitoring or querying of the device from by an SNMP server for management purposes. SNMP of any version will not be used to make configuration changes to the device. SNMPv3 must be disabled by default and enabled only if used. SNMP v3 provides security feature enhancements to SNMP, including encryption and message authentication.\n\nCurrently, the AES cipher block algorithm can be used for both applying cryptographic protection (e.g., encryption) and removing or verifying the protection that was previously applied (e.g., decryption) in DOD. The use of FIPS-approved algorithms for both cryptographic mechanisms is required. If any version of SNMP is used for remote administration, default SNMP community strings such as \"public\" and \"private\" should be removed before real community strings are put into place. If the defaults are not removed, an attacker could retrieve real community strings from the device using the default string.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",
