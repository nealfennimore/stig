The application does the following:\n\n(a) Retrieve the name of the real dead-letter queue. To do this, it opens the queue manager object using MQOPEN, and then issues an MQINQ to get the dead-letter queue name.\n\n(b) Build the name of the alias queue by appending the characters \".PUT\" to this name, in this case, ssid.DEAD.QUEUE.PUT.\n\n(c) Open the alias queue, ssid.DEAD.QUEUE.PUT.\n\n(d) Put the message on the real dead-letter queue by issuing an MQPUT against the alias queue.\n\n(5) Give the userid associated with the application update authority to the alias, but no access to the real dead-letter queue.\n\nNOTE: If an alias queue is not used in place of the dead-letter queue, then the ACP rules for the dead-letter queue will be coded to restrict unauthorized users and systems from reading the messages on the file.\n\nUndeliverable messages can be routed to a dead-letter queue. Two levels of access should be established for these queues. The first level allows applications, as well as some MQSeries/WebSphere MQ objects, to put messages to this queue. The second level restricts the ability to get messages from this queue and protects sensitive data. This will be accomplished by defining an alias queue that resolves to the real dead-letter queue, but defines the alias queue with the attributes PUT(ENABLED) and GET(DISABLED). The ability to get messages from the dead-letter queue will be restricted to message channel agents (MCAs), CKTI (MQSeries/WebSphere MQ-supplied CICS task initiator), channel initiators utility, and any automated application used for dead-letter queue maintenance.",
