An account can be created on the device's local database for use when the authentication server is down or connectivity between the device and the authentication server is not operable. This account is referred to as the \"account of last resort\" since it is intended to be used as a last resort and when immediate administrative access is absolutely necessary.\n\nThe account of last resort logon credentials must be stored in a sealed envelope and kept in a safe. The safe must be periodically audited to verify the envelope remains sealed. The signature of the auditor and the date of the audit must be added to the envelope as a record. Administrators must secure the credentials and disable the root account (if possible) when not needed for system administration functions.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

Information system backup is a critical step in ensuring system integrity and availability. If the system fails and there is no backup of the system-level information, a denial-of-service condition is possible for all who utilize this critical network component.\n\nPerform scheduled backups of the Forescout system to FTP, SFTP, and SCP sites. Using scheduled backups provides extra safety and protection against hard drive failures and data loss. \n\nThe system backup feature saves all CounterACT device and Console settings. \n\nThis data includes the following:\n- Configuration\n- License\n- Operating System configuration\n- Plugins/Modules\n\nThese categories include, for example:\n- Forescout platform IP address\n- License information\n- Channel\n- Email\n- Internal network parameters\n- Basic and advanced NAC Policy definitions\n- Legitimate traffic definitions\n- Report schedules</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",
