          "description": "<VulnDiscussion>Microphones used with VTC systems and devices are designed to be extremely sensitive so the voice of anyone speaking anywhere within a conference room is picked up and amplified so they can be heard clearly and understood at the remote location on the call. This same sensitivity is included in VTUs that are used in office spaces. This has one disadvantage. The microphones can pick up sidebar conversations that have no relationship to the conference or call in progress. \n\nLikewise, in an open area, received conference audio can be broadcast to others in the area that are not part of the conference and possibly should not be exposed to the conference information for need-to-know reasons. Speakerphones exhibit a similar vulnerability. This is the same confidentiality vulnerability posed to audible sound information in the environment as discussed above, with the added twist that the conference audio is vulnerable to others in the environment. While this is more of an issue in environments where classified conversations normally occur, it is also an issue in any environment. This is of particularly concern in open work areas or open offices where multiple people work in near proximity. \n\nUsers or operators of VTC systems of any type must take care regarding who can hear what is being said during a conference call and what unrelated conversations can be picked up by the sensitive microphone. Where a VTU is used by a single person in an open area, a partial mitigation for this could be the use of a headset with earphones and a microphone. While this would limit the ability of others to hear audio from the conference and could also limit the audio pickup of unrelated conversations, it may not be fully effective. \n\nIn some instances, such as when a VTU is located in a SCIF, a Push-to-Talk (PTT) handset/headset may be required Microphones embedded in or connected to a communications endpoint, PC, or PC monitor can be sensitive enough to pick up sound that is not related to a given communications session. They could pick up nearby conversations and other sounds. This capability could compromise sensitive or classified information that is not related to the communications in progress. Speakers embedded in or connected to a communications endpoint or PC can be made loud enough to be heard across a room or in the next workspace. This capability could compromise sensitive or classified information that is being communicated during a session. \n\nUsers must be aware of other conversations in the area and their sensitivity when using any communications endpoint (not only a PC-based voice, video, or collaboration communications application). This awareness must then translate into protecting or eliminating these other conversations. A short-range, reduced-gain, or noise-cancelling microphone may be required. A PTT microphone may also be required for classified areas. The microphone should be muted when the user is not speaking as both mitigation for this issue and proper etiquette when participating in a conference. The muting function should be performed using a positively controlled disconnect, shorting switch, or mechanism instead of a software-controlled mute function on the PC. \n\nUsers must be aware of other people in the area that could hear what is being communicated. This is particularly an issue if the communicated information is sensitive or classified because the parties overhearing the information may not have proper clearance or a need-to-know. To mitigate this issue, a headset or speakers should be used and at a volume that only the user can hear.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

          "description": "<VulnDiscussion>Traditional telephone systems require physical wiring and/or switch configuration changes to add an instrument to the system. This makes it difficult for someone to add unauthorized digital instruments to the system. However, this could be done more easily with older analog systems by tapping an existing analog line. \n\nWith Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging, this is no longer the case. Most IPT/VoIP systems employ an automatic means of detecting and registering a new instrument on the network with the call management server and then downloading its configuration to the instrument. This presents a vulnerability whereby unauthorized instruments could be added to the system or instruments could be moved without authorization. Such activity can happen anywhere there is an active network port or outlet. \n\nThis is not only a configuration management problem. It could also allow theft of services or some other malicious attack. It is recognized however, that auto-registration is necessary during large deployments of VoIP terminals, and for a short time thereafter, to facilitate additions and troubleshooting. This applies to initial system setup and any subsequent large redeployments or additions. Normal, day-to-day moves, adds, and changes will require manual registration. Because it may be possible for an unauthorized VoIP terminal to be added to the system easily during auto-registration, the registration logs must be compared to the authorized terminal inventory. \n\nAlternately, the system could have a method of automatically registering only preauthorized terminals. This feature would support VoIP terminals that are AO approved for connection from multiple local or remote locations. It is critical to the security of the system that all IPT/VoIP end instruments be authorized to connect to and use the system. Only authorized instruments should be configured in the system controller and therefore allowed to operate. Unauthorized instruments could lead to system compromise or abuse. A manual inventory of authorized end instruments will aid in the detection of unauthorized instruments registered to the system, particularly during the period when autodetection/registration is permitted. This will also aid in certification and accreditation efforts.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

DISA provides a worldwide VoIP-based voice communications service called the DISN Voice over Secret IP (VoSIP). This service is managed by the DRSN PMO. This service also provides gateways into the DRSN. \n\nIn support of the above requirement, the SIPRNet PMO has designated specific dedicated address ranges for use by the DISN VoSIP service and assigned these address blocks to the DRSN/VoSIP PMO for VoSIP address management and assignment. The VoSIP service provides VoIP-based communications between VoIP systems within the customer's classified LANs (C-LANs) operating at the secret level while using the SIPRNet WAN for the inter-enclave (inter-LAN) transport. \n\nAdditionally, the SIPRNet PMO requires networkwide address-based accountability or traceability based on assigned IP address. The customer's SIPRNet-connected secret C-LANs use addresses assigned by the SIPRNet PMO. Therefore, customers of the DISN VoSIP service must use IP addresses assigned to them by the DRSN/VoSIP PMO when addressing the VoIP controllers and endpoints within their C-LANs. This is to maintain the segregation of the voice and data environments on the customer's secret C-LANs as required by this SRG. This also facilitates proper routing and flow control over the traffic between VoSIP addresses. \n\nThe DISN service is designated DISN Voice over Secret IP but uses an acronym (VoSIP), which also means Voice over Secure IP. Voice over Secure IP relates to any VoIP-based service on a secure or classified IP network. \n\nWhile the DISN VoSIP service is the preferred means to interconnect SIPRNet-connected secret C-LANs for VoIP service, there may be a need for an organization to implement a VoIP-based voice or video communications system within their organization or with close partners.

While these devices might be used to meet a specific mission requirement, their use may be illegal in certain countries and instances when connected between a DOD IP voice and data network and a public dial-up voice network. The use of any UC soft client accessory that provides a network bridging function poses both a legal and an IA threat to the DOD voice communications network.

          "description": "<VulnDiscussion>This and several other requirements discuss the implementation of PC soft-phones or UC applications as the primary and only communications device in the user's workspace. \n\nWhile this degrades the protections afforded a hardware-based system, the trend is to use more and more PC-based communications applications due to their advanced features, collaborative benefits, and perceived reduced cost. This soft-phone use case results in the elimination of hardware-based telephones on users' desks in the workplace. This can be seen as, or result in, trading down (from a hardware-based system) with regard to availability, reliability, and quality of service because the data network is generally more susceptible to compromise from many sources inside and outside the local LAN, making the soft-phones more exposed to attack. \n\nThis also means no telephone will be available in the workspace if the PC is not powered on, the application is not loaded, or the PC is not fully functional. While this is undesirable from an IA standpoint, a business case can be developed to support it. \n\nNOTE: The recommended relationship between PC soft-phone/UC applications and hardware-based endpoints in the normal work area is that the PC application should augment the functionality of, or be a backup to, the hardware-based instrument in the user's workspace. The implementation of PC soft-phones or UC applications in the user workspace as their only endpoint has several ramifications that must be considered. These include: \n\n- The PC becomes a single point of failure for communications services provided to a user in their workspace. A widespread problem, which affects many PCs or the network infrastructure, may disable all communications for many users at one time. Users may not have a means to report the failure without using an alternate communications system. A fast-spreading worm or power outage could create such a situation. While some may argue that \"users can call on their cell phones\", service may not be available, or their use may not be permitted in the facility. This translates into the loss of functionality and efficiency, as in lost time, due to the inability to communicate when the PC or soft-phone application is not running or functioning properly.\n\n- The protections afforded hardware-based endpoints by the use of the voice protection zone, such as VoIP VLAN(s) and others, are missing for soft-phones in a widespread use/implementation scenario and, depending on the implementation on the PC, may degrade the protections afforded hardware-based endpoints. Such is the case for all software-based communications endpoints because they are typically implemented on all PCs and therefore will be connected to the data VLANs. Assured service for voice traffic will be degraded from that obtained with hardware-based instruments connected in the voice protection zone. This translates into the following additional IA measures required to protect the VoIP infrastructure (e.g., a firewall between the VoIP and data VLANs):\n \n- The hardware-based endpoint is not available for use in parallel with, or in place of, the PC. This can be a problem if the PC is having performance or operational issues, is turned off, or is unavailable. Accessing help desk services requiring logging on to the PC to use the voice services and work on a problem could be a real challenge. Rebooting the PC to clear a problem would disconnect the call to the helpdesk. Accessing voice mail or answering the phone while the PC is booting is made impossible, reducing efficiency, particularly when the user starts their day. If the user has command and control (C2) responsibilities, the IP equivalent of MLPP cannot function properly if an application or PC is unavailable. Precedence calls will not be received by the user but will be transferred to their designated alternate answering point. \n\n- Emergency communications could be unavailable if the PC is not booted, the communications application is not running, or either is otherwise compromised. Voice communications must be readily available for life safety and medical reasons, as well as other facility security emergencies. A partial mitigation for this in a \"soft-phone world\" is to place common use hardware telephones within a short distance (e.g., 30 to 50 feet) of every workspace, which is an additional cost. This additional distance, however, could be an issue in a medical emergency where a worker might be alone in their workspace and their PC or voice communications application is not functioning properly. They may not be able to reach the common use instrument depending on the nature of the medical emergency. If the worker was suffering a heart attack or diabetic emergency, they could die. Business cases therefore need to include the cost of insurance and/or lawsuits for this eventuality. \n\nThe previous two items translate into the following the addition of common-use hardware-based instruments placed around the facility (for backup and emergency use) along with the additionally required LAN cabling and access switch ports. While some may believe this is not an IA issue, it is because the discussion is about availability, which is one of the prime tenets of IA. \n\nAdditionally, the VoIP controllers (i.e., the equipment that controls the telephone system) must be able to be accessed by the PC soft-phones while being protected as they would be in a normal VoIP system using hardware-based instruments. \n\nNOTE: Methods for permitting the necessary PC traffic to, from, and between the voice and data zones while protecting the voice zone will be discussed later in this document.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

Traditional computer telephony integration CTI encompasses the control of a telephone or telecommunications switch by a computer application. Interfaces have been developed to provide connection between the computer, typically a workstation, and the telephone or other terminal attached to the telephone switch, and possibly a special analog or TDM line going directly to the telephone switch. \n\nApplications are also developed to use these interfaces to integrate a data application with the telephone system. Sometimes the integration is as simple as being able to dial a number from the computer application, or it could provide full control of the switch as in the case of an operator's console. \n\nIn these traditional scenarios, the voice stayed in a traditional telephone set and the data stayed on the computer with the exception of the control information. If the voice does enter the computer, it is sent directly to the sound card or converted to a sound file for storage and possible file transfer. The voice communication is not transmitted in real time via IP protocols. In contrast, modern-day CTI is changing in that today the voice communications and control is being transmitted using IP protocols, and the hardware interfaces and telephones are being replaced by computer applications. \n\nNOTE: The CTI systems discussed here are not Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging applications, although some of the features are similar. CTI systems generally have a special function and are not a general user application. These are typically Call Center or Help Desk applications. This type of CTI typically involves integration with a database application. In this scenario, where soft-phones are an integral part of the CTI system/application, implementation of separate voice and data zones could be detrimental to the proper functioning of the application. While separation requirements should be enforced if possible, they could be relaxed providing the general CTI requirement of treating the CTI system as an enclave is followed. A system such as this should have its own VoIP controller. If the system needs to communicate with systems outside the CTI system enclave, proper boundary protection must be provided. For example, because IP soft-phones are prevalent in today's call center/helpdesk systems, such a system would require the ability to place and receive phone calls from outside the CTI enclave. Calls might leave and enter the enclave via VoIP or a TDM media gateway. The workstations and call center agents may also need to email and access the web. \n\nNOTE: A network supporting a CTI application must be segregated from the enclave. This can be accomplished by maintaining a closed network or a segregated and access-controlled subenclave having appropriate boundary protection.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

          "description": "<VulnDiscussion>Voice phone services are critical to the effective operation of a business, an office, or in support or control of a DOD mission. It is critical that phone service is available in the event of an emergency situation, such as a security breach or life safety event. The ability to place calls to emergency services must be maintained. DOD voice networks are designed to be extremely reliable and provide continuity of operations (COOP) support. \n\nHowever, the potential exists that a site may become severed from the DOD network. Some site's DOD VoIP phone systems are implemented without a local session controller. The session controller may be located remotely and serve several sites by providing long local service. This implementation scenario provides for central management of the overall phone system, saves in initial implementation cost, and saves in operating costs. Therefore, this scenario has many benefits. \n\nUnfortunately, to place a call between two endpoints within the local site or to place a call via the local commercial service connection, the initiating end instrument has to send its signal messages to the remote session controller over the DISN WAN connection, and then the session controller has to signal the called instrument or media gateway over the same WAN connection. Several messages are sent (back and forth) over the WAN connection before the two local endpoints can send their media streams directly between themselves. \n\nWhile the need to signal over the WAN connection can cause longer call setup time, which can be extended if there is congestion in the network, no call can be placed anywhere from the local site if it is cut off from its session controller. Based on this fact, and in support of maintaining viable local voice services in the event the site is cut off from its remote session controller, each physical site must maintain minimal local call control as a backup so that local intrasite and local commercial network calls can be placed. While this works to maintain local emergency service availability for security and life safety emergencies, it also provides the capability to make calls between DOD sites using the commercial network.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

          "description": "<VulnDiscussion>Emergency communications must include requests for fire, police, and medical assistance. In DOD, these communications can also include requests for Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF), explosive ordnance disposal, and similar emergency situations specific to the military. \n\nThe inability of first responders to automatically locate the caller threatens life safety and facility protection or security. Contacting emergency services via the public telephone system has been mandated for many years in the United States and other countries around the world. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has mandated various aspects of providing enhanced FES communications and also relies on state legislation to extend these rules. The FCC rules primarily address public communications service providers, including traditional LEC and CLECs, mobile communications providers, and VoIP communications providers. \n\nDOD Instruction 6055.06, DOD Fire and Emergency Services (F&ES) Program, provides DOD policy regarding emergency services and emergency services communications. The document primarily discusses fire protection, with specific provisions for telecommunications support for fire, medical, and security emergencies. Private telephone systems, in general, provide a large portion of the required telecommunication capability. All DOD private telephone systems, VoIP or traditional, must support enhanced emergency services communications for the completion of emergency calls. Per DOD Instruction 6055.06, all sites must support, provide for, and implement F&ES telecommunications services. When implementing basic F&ES telecommunications services, each country or region designates a specific standard telephone number or prefix code to be dialed that can be easily remembered by the public. In some instances, while not best practice, organizations might designate an internal emergency number for use within their telephone system. Examples of such numbers are as follows: \n- 911 in North America. \n- 112 in the EU and UK. \n- 000 in Australia. \n\nIssues may arise when an emergency call is originated through a private telephone system, such as a traditional PBX or a VVoIP system. While the LEC or CLEC may properly route the call in a priority manner, the same may not be true for the private system unless specifically addressed in the systems call routing tables and potentially other system features. Therefore, the private system must be configured to properly handle emergency communications. Enhanced F&ES communications permits the answering station to automatically locate the caller. This is particularly helpful when the caller cannot provide their location. \n\nEnhanced F&ES communications are mandated by the FCC and state legislation. Current implementation is a best practice. The enhanced F&ES communications capability is enabled using Automatic Number Identification (ANI) and Phone Switch Automatic Location Identification (PS-ALI) information. ANI provides the telephone number of the calling party and is generated by the telephone system. PS-ALI associates the calling party's number (ANI information) with their location or registered address of the phone being used. PS-ALI is provided by a database maintained within the telephone system or externally. In many cases, the F&ES answering service system will use the PS-ALI information to map the location of the calling phone. VoIP phones, on the other hand, can be connected anywhere in the world and function. This is an issue for commercial VoIP services that is being addressed by the FCC. ALI information in the private sector must be handled by the owners/operators of private telephone system. When a private telephone system supports enhanced F&ES telecommunications, a PS-ALI database must be instituted, maintained, and kept current as endpoints and numbers move at a site. \n\nNOTE: For fire and emergency services, the requirements are for the site. The requirement must be met through the unclassified system. Classified systems at the site, because they only operate in secure areas without connection to public services, do not need to implement this requirement.\n\nReferences: \nDOD Instruction No. 6055.06, DOD Fire and Emergency Services (F&ES) Program, dated 21 Dec 2006</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

          "description": "<VulnDiscussion>Under Federal Communication Commission (FCC) rules and the laws of some states, the implementation of Enhanced F&ES telecommunications services requires that the emergency services answering point or call center must be automatically provided with enough location information so that emergency services personnel can locate the calling party within a specified radius at their exact location in the event they are unable to provide their location. This is a two-part process that is exacerbated if the call originates from a DOD telephone system. \n\nSome of the FCC rules and state laws address the telephone system issue. For enterprise systems, the support for E911 by the enterprise Local Session Controller (LSC) (or any remote LSC construct) is governed by FCC rules, as well as other federal, state, and local law. The design and implementation of all telephone system systems must include reasonable efforts to provide E911, even when the access connection to the Enterprise LSC is severed.\n\nPublic enhanced F&ES systems are implemented in conjunction with the local exchange carrier (LEC) using their central office switch (CO). When the designated F&ES number is dialed, the CO routes the call to the public F&ES answering point (PSAP) over special trunks that can provide the PSAP with the telephone number from which the emergency call originated and the geographic location of the originating telephone. The originating telephone number is provided as ANI information. The geographic location of the originating telephone is provided as ALI information. The ALI is generated from the ANI by looking up the ANI in a database. Typically, this function is performed by the LEC, and the ALI provided is the service delivery address for the telephone number. In some cases, the ALI information is housed in a database at the PSAP or a at a third-party provider such that the PSAP must make the \"database dip\" to identify the location of the caller. The information is regularly updated by the LEC based on new service deliveries and disconnections.\n\nThis process does not go far enough if the originating telephone is behind (part of) a DOD telephone system. A DOD telephone system may serve a large building or multiple buildings in a campus setting. It may also serve small or large remote sites that are geographically distant from the main telephone system switch. As discussed above, the normal process provides the address where the LEC delivers its phone service for the calling number. While this address will serve to get emergency services personnel to the lobby of a building or the front gate of a campus, it will not provide the exact location of the caller. This is where the federal and state telephone system related requirements come in. Under these rules, a telephone system operator and the system itself must provide complete ANI and ALI information to the answering point such that emergency services personnel can easily locate the caller. The telephone system must provide the exact location of the originating telephone minimally within a reasonably small area of it. The location information provided for telephones behind a telephone system is called Phone Switch-ALI (PS-ALI). \n\nTo implement this, the telephone system must first be able to provide the F&ES answering station with the telephone number from which the emergency call originated via ANI. If the answering point is outside the telephone system, the number provided must be the exact Direct Inward Dialing (DID) number of the telephone placing the call so the answering point can dial it directly. The number provided must not be that of an outbound trunk. This phone number must be correlated to its physical address or location within the facility via PS-ALI. \n\nTo implement PS-ALI, the owner/operator of a telephone system is responsible for maintaining an up-to-date database containing the telephone number (DID number and/or extension number) and physical location of each telephone attached to the telephone system. This database is then used to provide the PS-ALI information to the ALI database(s) accessed by the F&ES answering point. In association with each telephone and telephone number in the telephone system, the PS-ALI information contained in the database includes the following: \n- The address of the site containing the telephone system unless provided to the answering point by the LEC as part of its ANI/ALI information.\n- The name (or number) of the building in which the telephone is located.\n- The address of the building in which the telephone is located.\n- The floor in the building on which the telephone is located.\n- The area or quadrant of the floor where the telephone is located.\n- The room or cubicle number where the telephone is located.\n\nAdditional information should be provided to the F&ES answering point and emergency services personnel in the form of up-to-date facility maps and floor plans. The maintenance of facility maps, floor plans, and PS-ALI information to keep them up to date is critical to life safety and facility protection and security. This can be an onerous process in light of changes in the facility and moves, adds, and changes within the telephone system. Maintaining accurate location information is exacerbated in a VoIP telephone system due to the ability of an IP phone to change its physical location within the LAN (and possibly beyond) while keeping its telephone number without specific intervention from, or knowledge of, the telephone system operator. The PS_ALI database can quickly become inaccurate, which is a situation that could be life threatening. \n\nAutomated systems can be used with a VoIP system and LAN to identify the general location of an IP phone within the facility based on the LAN switch and port to which the phone is connected. Once this information is obtained from the LAN, it is correlated with the documented location of the LAN switch and documented location of the outlet served by the switchport.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

An MFSS provides the following functions: \n- Receives AS-SIP-TLS messages from other MFSSs and a specific set of regionally associated LSCs to act as a call routing manager across the backbone. \n- Sends AS-SIP-TLS messages to interrogate the ability of another MFSS or an LSC to receive a call, whether routine or priority. \n- Sends AS-SIP-TLS messages to manage the establishment of priority calls and the preemption of lower priority calls to LSCs and other MFSSs.\n- Once a \"trunk side\" session request is received, the MFSS determines if the destination is one of its assigned LSCs. If so, it interrogates that LSC to determine if it can receive the call. If so, it signals to establish the call. If the destination is not one of its LSCs, it signals with other MFSSs to locate the destination LSC and then the remote MFSS negotiates with its LSC. \n- Acts as a backup MFSS for LSCs assigned to other MFSSs as primary. An LSC must be able to signal with an MFSS to establish any call across the DISN WAN. LSCs do not interact directly with LSCs. This hierarchical arrangement is required in order to manage and establish priority calls and manage access circuit budgets. Each LSC must have a backup MFSS. In support of this function, MFSSs must be operated in pairs with all the information about its assigned LSCs replicated across the pair.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",
