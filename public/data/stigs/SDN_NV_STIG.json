It routes the encapsulated packets based on the outer IP address header, which has the initiating VTEP as the source IP address and the terminating VTEP as the destination IP address.\n\nEach VXLAN segment is mapped to an IP multicast group in the transport IP network. Hence, VTEPs join IP multicast groups based on VNI membership. This is the method by which VTEPs can discover other VTEPs belonging to the same VXLAN segment. Each VTEP-enabled switch is configured to join the applicable multicast group for each VNI through Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). The IGMP joins will trigger Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) joins, thereby signaling a multicast distribution tree for each group through the transport network based on the locations of participating VTEPs.\nThe multicast group is used to transmit broadcast, unknown unicast, and multicast traffic through the IP network for each VXLAN segment, limiting all Layer 2 flooding to those switches that have end systems participating in the same VXLAN segment.\n\nBecause the VNI is used to segregate all Layer 2 domains via the VXLAN header encapsulation by the VTEPs, and discovery of each VTEP member is dependent on a specific multicast group, it is imperative that the correct mapping of multicast groups to VNI is configured.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",
