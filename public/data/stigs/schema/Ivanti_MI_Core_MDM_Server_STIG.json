Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.\n\nSession termination terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.\n\nConditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use.\n\nThis capability is typically reserved for specific application system functionality where the system owner, data owner, or organization requires additional assurance. Based upon requirements and events specified by the data or application owner, the application developer must incorporate logic into the application that will provide a control mechanism that disconnects users upon the defined event trigger.

For an algorithm implementation to be listed on a FIPS 140-2 cryptographic module validation certificate as an approved security function, the algorithm implementation must meet all the requirements of FIPS 140-2 and must successfully complete the cryptographic algorithm validation process. Currently, NIST has approved the following confidentiality modes to be used with approved block ciphers in a series of special publications: ECB, CBC, OFB, CFB, CTR, XTS-AES, FF1, FF3, CCM, GCM, KW, KWP, and TKW.\n\nSatisfies: FCS_COP.1.1(1), FTP_TRP.1.1(1)  \nReference: PP-MDM-414001</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",
