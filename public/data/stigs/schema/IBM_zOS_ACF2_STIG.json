The following is a list of actions that can be performed to accomplish this recommendation:\n\na. Ensure that MSTJCLxx contains only PROCLIB data sets that contain STC and TSO procedures.\nb. If an application PROCLIB data set is required for JES2, ensure that the JES2 procedure specifies more than one PROCxx DD statement concatenation or identified in the JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions. Identify one PROCxx DD statement data set concatenation that contains the STC and TSO PROCLIB data sets. Identify one or more additional PROCxx DD statements that can contain any other PROCLIB data sets. The concatenation of the additional PROCxx DD statements can contain the same data sets that are identified in the PROCxx DD statement for STC and TSO. The following is an example of the JES2 procedure:\n\n//JES2 PROC \n//IEFPROC EXEC PGM=HASJES20,PARM=NOREQ, \n//DPRTY=(15,15),TIME=1440,PERFORM=9 \n//ALTPARM DD DISP=SHR, \n//DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(JES2BKUP) \n//HASPPARM DD DISP=SHR, \n//DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(JES2PARM) \n//PROC00 DD DSN=SYS3.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR \n//DD DSN=SYS2.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR\n//DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR \n//PROC01 DD DSN=SYS4.USERPROC,DISP=SHR \n//DD DSN=SYS3.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR \n//DD DSN=SYS2.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR \n//DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR \n//IEFRDER DD SYSOUT=* \n//HASPLIST DD DDNAME=IEFRDER\n\nc. Ensure that the JES2 configuration file is changed to specify that the PROCLIB entry for the STC and TSU JOBCLASSes point to the proper PROCxx entry within the JES2 procedure or JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions that contain the STC and/or TSO procedures. All other JOBCLASSes can specify a PROCLIB entry that uses the same PROCxx or any other PROCxx DD statement identified in the JES2 procedure or identified in the JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions. The following is an example of the JES2 initialization parameters:\n\nJOBCLASS(*) ACCT=NO, /* ACCT # NOT REQUIRED (DEF.)*/ \n...\nPROCLIB=01, /* DEFAULT TO //PROC01 DD (DEF.)*/\n...\nJOBCLASS(STC) AUTH=ALL, /* ALLOW ALL COMMANDS (DEF.)*/ \n...\nPROCLIB=00, /* USE //PROC00 DD (DEF.)*/ \n...\nJOBCLASS(TSU) AUTH=ALL, /* ALLOW ALL COMMANDS (DEF.)*/\n...\nPROCLIB=00, /* USE //PROC00 DD (DEF.)*/ \n...\n\nd.

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.\n\nAccess control policies include: identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include: access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.\n\nWithout the capability to restrict which roles and individuals can select which events are audited, unauthorized personnel may be able to prevent the auditing of critical events. Misconfigured audits may degrade the system's performance by overwhelming the audit log. Misconfigured audits may also make it more difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-OS-000063-GPOS-00032, SRG-OS-000080-GPOS-00048, SRG-OS-000259-GPOS-00100, SRG-OS-000324-GPOS-00125, SRG-OS-000337-GPOS-00129, SRG-OS-000362-GPOS-00149</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability of individual activity.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-OS-000104-GPOS-00051, SRG-OS-000121-GPOS-00062, SRG-OS-000125-GPOS-00065</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

Operating systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from nonsecurity functions) in a number of ways, including through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code.\n\nDevelopers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles. Implementation may include isolation of memory space and libraries. Operating systems restrict access to security functions through the use of access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities.\n\nPreventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access to information or privileges.\n\nPrivileged functions include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-OS-000134-GPOS-00068, SRG-OS-000080-GPOS-00048, SRG-OS-000259-GPOS-00100, SRG-OS-000324-GPOS-00125</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.\n\nAccess control policies include: identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include: access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary.

Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography.
