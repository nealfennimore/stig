A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. \n\nA comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated or by disabling accounts located in noncentralized account stores such as multiple servers. This requirement applies to all account types, including individual/user, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service.\n\nDragos Platform must be configured to automatically provide account management functions and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy. The automated mechanisms may reside within Dragos Platform itself or may be offered by the operating system or other infrastructure providing automated account management capabilities. Automated mechanisms may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements. \n\nAccount management functions include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephonic notification to report atypical system account usage.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-APP-000023, SRG-APP-000025, SRG-APP-000065, SRG-APP-000149, SRG-APP-000150, SRG-APP-000151, SRG-APP-000152, SRG-APP-000163, SRG-APP-000165, SRG-APP-000170, SRG-APP-000173, SRG-APP-000233, SRG-APP-000345, SRG-APP-000317, SRG-APP-000318</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

It supports disaster recovery, regulatory compliance, forensic investigations, and overall operational resilience, thereby strengthening the organization's cybersecurity posture.\n\nStoring backup audit records in a separate location ensures that even if the primary system is compromised or experiences a failure, the audit records remain intact and secure. This separation enhances the overall integrity and security of the audit data.\n\nIn the event of a catastrophic event such as a cyberattack, hardware failure, or natural disaster, having backup audit records stored offsite allows for recovery of critical audit data. This capability is essential for restoring operations and conducting post-incident analyses.\n\nIn the aftermath of a security incident, forensic investigators rely on audit records to reconstruct events and understand the nature and impact of the incident. Backup audit records provide a reliable source of information for these investigations, even if the primary records are tampered with or deleted.\n\nRegularly backing up audit records ensures operational continuity by safeguarding critical data. In case of an unexpected event, the Dragos Platform can quickly access the backup records to continue monitoring and analyzing security events without significant disruption.\n\nRegular backups of audit records help ensure accountability by providing a reliable and tamper-evident log of activities.

This is crucial for protecting sensitive information, such as security logs, configurations, and other operational data, from being accessed if the disk is physically stolen or if unauthorized access is obtained.\n\nIn the event of a security breach, encrypted disks prevent attackers from easily accessing the data stored on the VMs. This is particularly important for mitigating the risks associated with data breaches, including the potential exposure of sensitive operational technology (OT) and industrial control system (ICS) data.\n\nVMs can be snapshotted or cloned, creating exact copies of the VM, including its data. Disk encryption ensures that even if a snapshot or clone is made, the data remains protected and cannot be accessed without the appropriate decryption keys.\n\nDisk encryption protects data at rest, which is data stored on the disk when the system is not in use. This is a critical aspect of data security, as it ensures that the data remains protected even if the VM is powered off or in a dormant state.\n\nFor organizations using both on-premises and cloud environments, disk encryption provides a consistent approach to data security. This helps maintain uniform security policies and practices across different infrastructure setups.\n\nIn multi-tenant environments, where multiple virtual machines run on the same physical hardware, disk encryption ensures that data on one VM cannot be accessed by other tenants or compromised VMs on the same host.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

This could include policies related to encryption, authentication, or other security-related settings.\n\nTest Configuration: \nAfter enabling FIPS mode and configuring any necessary settings, perform testing to ensure that only FIPS-approved cryptographic algorithms are being used within the virtual environment.

          "description": "<VulnDiscussion>Without device-to-device authentication, communications with malicious devices may be established. Bidirectional authentication provides stronger safeguards to validate the identity of other devices for connections that are of greater risk.\n\nCurrently, DOD requires the use of AES for bidirectional authentication since it is the only FIPS-validated AES cipher block algorithm. The NTP uses MD5 authentication keys. The MD5 algorithm is not approved for use in either the FIPS or NIST recommendation; thus, a CAT 1 finding is allocated in CCI-000803. However, the use of MD5 is preferred to no authentication at all and can be used to mitigate this requirement to a CAT II finding.\n\nThe trusted-key statement permits authenticating NTP servers. The product must be configured to support separate keys for each NTP server. Severs should have PKI device certificate involved for use in the device authentication process.\n\nServer authentication is performed by the client using the server's public key certificate, which the server presents during the handshake. The exact nature of the cryptographic operation for server authentication is dependent on the negotiated cipher suite and extensions. In most cases (e.g., RSA for key transport, DH, and ECDH), authentication is performed explicitly through verification of digital signatures present in certificates and implicitly by the use of the server public key by the client during the establishment of the master secret. A successful \"Finished\" message implies that both parties calculated the same master secret and thus, the server must have known the private key corresponding to the public key used for key establishment.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",
