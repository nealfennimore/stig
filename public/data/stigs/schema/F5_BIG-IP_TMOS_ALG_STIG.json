This results in unanticipated application behavior potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.\n\nNetwork devices with the functionality to perform application layer inspection may be leveraged to validate data content of network communications. Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software typically follows well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If network elements use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Pre-screening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.\n\nThis requirement applies to gateways and firewalls that perform content inspection or have higher-layer proxy functionality.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

Furthermore, the encryption of all data transmitted between the client and server ensures that even if an attacker intercepts the data, it remains unintelligible without the correct keys.\n\nTo ensure the use of the mTLS for session authentication, do not use the On-Demand Cert Auth VPE agent. Typically, when a client makes an HTTPS request, an SSL handshake request occurs at the start of an SSL session. However, if On-Demand is configured, the client SSL profile skips the initial SSL handshake, an On-Demand Cert Auth action can re-negotiate the SSL connection from an access policy by sending a certificate request to the user. This prompts a certificate screen to open. Setting ODCA to \"require\" the client cert means the client cannot get any farther in the APM VPE without providing a valid certificate. \"Request\" would ask the client for a certificate, but the client could still continue if they did not provide one. Thus, the Client Certificate must be set to \"require\" in the client SSL profile since just removing ODCA from the VPE alone will result in the client never getting prompted for a certificate.\n\nWithin the Virtual Policy Editor (VPE) of the relevant Access Profile, do not use the On-Demand Cert Auth VPE agent. Configure only the Client Certification Inspection VPE Agent. This adjustment directs the BIG-IP to scrutinize the Client Certificate during the mTLS handshake process and extract the certificate's details into APM session variables.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",
