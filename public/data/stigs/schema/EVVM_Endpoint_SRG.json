Single-host allows only one device to authenticate, and only packets from this devices MAC address will be allowed, dropping all other packets. Multi-host mode requires one host to authenticate but once this is done, all packets regardless of source MAC address will be allowed. For both the PC attached to the PC port and the Enterprise Voice, Video, and Messaging Endpoint to authenticate separately, multi-domain authentication on the access switchport must be configured. This divides the switchport into a data and a voice domain. In this case if more than one device attempts authorization on either the voice or the data domain of a port, the switchport goes into an error disable state.

          "description": "<VulnDiscussion>If passwords and PINs are not encrypted when stored, they may be read if the storage location is compromised. \n\nNote that DOD requires the use two-factor, CAC-enabled authentication and the use of passwords incurs a permanent finding. Passwords should be used only in limited situations.\n\nExamples of situations where a user ID and password might be used include:\n\n- When the user does not use a CAC and is not a current DOD employee, member of the military, or DOD contractor.\n\n- When a user has been officially designated as temporarily unable to present a CAC for some reason (lost, damaged, not yet issued, broken card reader) (i.e., Temporary Exception User) and to satisfy urgent organizational needs must be temporarily permitted to use user ID/password authentication until the problem with CAC use has been remedied.\n\n- When the application is publicly available and/or hosting publicly releasable data requiring some degree of need-to-know protection.\n\nIf the password is already encrypted and not a plaintext password, this meets this requirement. Implementation of this requirement requires configuration of FIPS-approved cipher block algorithm and block cipher modes for encryption. This method uses a one-way hashing encryption algorithm with a salt value to validate a user's password without having to store the actual password. Performance and time required to access are factors that must be considered, and the one-way hash is the most feasible means of securing the password and providing an acceptable measure of password security.\n\nVerify the user knows a password is performed using a password verifier. In its simplest form, a password verifier is a computational function that is capable of creating a hash of a password and determining if the value provided by the user matches the hash. A more secure version of verifying a user knowing a password is to store the result of an iterating hash function and a large random salt value as follows:\n\nH0 = H(pwd, H(salt))\nHn = H(Hn-1,H(salt))\n\nIn the above, \"n\" is a cryptographically strong random [*3] number. \"Hn\" is stored along with the salt. When the application wishes to verify that the user knows a password, it simply repeats the process and compares \"Hn\" with the stored \"Hn\". A salt is essentially a fixed-length cryptographically strong random value.\n\nAnother method is using a keyed hash message authentication code (HMAC). HMAC calculates a message authentication code via a cryptographic hash function used in conjunction with an encryption key. The key must be protected as with any private key.\n\nThis requirement applies to all accounts including authentication server; Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA), and local accounts, including the root account, and the account of last resort.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",
