Commercial transport services procured as an alternative to the DISN-provided transport requires compliance with this issuance or DoD CIO review and approval.”\n\nBased on the use cases below, verify written approval has been obtained from the Office of the DoD CIO or verify a renewal request has been appropriately submitted. There are three basic use cases for an ISP connection.  \n\nUse case (1): An ISP connection that originates from an approved DISN infrastructure source (includes IAP connections at the DECCs). A DoDIN Waiver is required for a CC/S/A to connect the unclassified DISN to an ISP. These connection requests must come to the Waiver Panel with a Component CIO endorsement of the requirement. These connections should not be provisioned and put into use until waived. Expired waivers pending renewal from the OSD DoDIN Waiver Panel may be downgraded to a Severity 3 category, if proof of a requested renewal can be verified. A DISN enclave that cannot prove DoDIN Waiver approval for the ISP connection is a Severity 1 category. Note: If discovered during a CCRI assessment, the review team lead will immediately report the unapproved ISP connection to the USCYBERCOM (301-688-3585) and the Connection Approval Office (301-225-2900/2901). USCYBERCOM will direct the connection be immediately disconnected. \n\nUse Case (2): An ISP connection to a Stand Alone Enclave (physically and logically separated from any DISN connection) requires DoDIN Waiver approval prior to connection. The Stand Alone Enclave must have an AO issued ATO and the connection must be logically and physically separated from the DISN. An unapproved ISP connection in this use case will be assigned a Severity 3 category.\n\nUse Case (3): An ISP connection to a non-DoD network (such as a contractor-owned infrastructure) co-located on the same premises as the DoD network. The non-DoD network is physically and logically separated from any DoD IP network. Furthermore, it is not connected to any DoD IP network. The non-DoD network infrastructure is not DoD funded nor is it operated or administered by DoD military or civilian personnel. In addition, the non-DoD network with the ISP connection is not storing, processing, or transmitting any DoD data. For such a network as defined herein, a DoDIN Waiver approval is not required for deploying a connection to an ISP. However, the AO must perform and have on file a risk assessment endorsed by the facility or installation command.\n\nIf any of the above use cases are applicable, and written approval has been not been obtained from the Office of the DoD CIO or a renewal request has not been submitted, this is a finding."

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) uses a passive method; receiving a copy of the packets to analyze and alert authorized persons about any malicious activity.  While an IDS or an IPS in a passive role cannot stop the attack itself, it can typically notify and dynamically assign ACLs or other rules to a firewall or router for filtering.  The preferred method of installation is to have the IDPS configured for inline mode.  Only when there is a valid technical reason, should the IDPS be placed into a passive or IDS mode.  For a full uninhibited view of the traffic, the IDPS must sit behind the enclave's firewall.

DiffServ QoS categorizes network traffic, prioritizes it according to its relative importance, and provides priority treatment based on the classification.

PIM operates independent of any particular IP routing protocol but makes use of the IP unicast routing table--PIM does not keep a separate multicast routing table. The multicast tree is built by first allowing a flood of traffic from the source to every dense mode router in the network. For a brief time, unnecessary traffic is allowed. As each router receives traffic for the group, it will decide whether it has active recipients wanting to receive the multicast data. If so, the router will let the flow continue. If no hosts have registered for the multicast group, the router sends a prune message to its neighbor toward the source. That branch of the tree is then pruned off so that the unnecessary traffic does not continue. Dense mode is viewed as a \"flood and prune\" implementation. With PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM), the multicast tree is not extended to a router unless a local host has already joined the group. The multicast tree is built by beginning with group members at the end leaf nodes and extending back toward a central root point--the tree is built from the bottom up. In either case, if an interface is not going to be supporting any of the multicast traffic--that is, join a multicast tree, PIM should be disabled.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

A static configuration is simple and convenient. However, if the statically defined RP router becomes unreachable, there is no automatic failover to another RP router. Auto-RP distributes information to routers as to which RP address must be used for various multicast groups. Auto-RP eliminates inconsistencies and enables scalability and automatic failover. All PIM-enabled routers join the RP discovery group (224.0.1.40), which allows them to receive all group-to-RP mapping information. This information is distributed by an entity called RP mapping agent. Mapping agents themselves join the RP announce group (224.0.1.39). All candidate RPs advertise themselves periodically using the RP announce group address. The mapping agent listens to all RP candidate announcements and determines which routers will be used for each multicast group. It then advertises the RP and its associate multicast groups to all PIM routers in the network using an RP discovery message. Auto-RP announcement and discovery messages provide information (i.e., IP addresses of the RP candidates, multicast groups, etc.) vital to the multicast domain and should not be leaked out of the multicast domain. Using this information, a malicious user could disrupt multicast services by attacking the RP or flooding bogus traffic destined to the learned multicast groups.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",
