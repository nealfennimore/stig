Many NACs include the ability to create network access control policies that include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. \n\nIt is recommended that Forescout have the capability to expose collected data on the assessed endpoints through an API that can be accessed externally, or the NAC solution must supply an SDK to allow customers to export data. \n\nAdmissions assessment filters should include, at a minimum, device attributes such as type, IP address, resource group, and/or mission conditions as defined in the Forescout SSP. Forescout should also track the following to facilitate security investigations: when each device was last admitted/readmitted to the network; owning organization; owning organization's organizational unit; geographic location or the nearest network switch; motherboard serial number and BIOS; globally unique ID; and which unique network access compliance policies each device passed or failed during the latest network admission/readmission.\n\nThe client may be denied admission based on a returned posture token.

          "description": "<VulnDiscussion>Limiting the number of registered MAC addresses on a switch access port can help prevent a CAM table overflow attack. This type of attack lets an attacker exploit the hardware and memory limitations of a switch. If there are enough entries stored in a CAM table before the expiration of other entries, no new entries can be accepted into the CAM table. An attacker will be able to flood the switch with mostly invalid MAC addresses until the CAM table's resources have been depleted. When there are no more resources, the switch has no choice but to flood all ports within the VLAN with all incoming traffic. This happens because the switch cannot find the switch port number for a corresponding MAC address within the CAM table, allowing the switch to become a hub and traffic to be monitored.\n\nSome technologies are exempt from requiring a single MAC address per access port; however, restrictions still apply. VoIP or VTC endpoints may provide a PC port so a PC can be connected. Each of the devices will need to be statically assigned to each access port.\n\nHot-desking is where several people are assigned to work at the same desk at different times, each user with their own PC. In this case, a different MAC address needs to be permitted for each PC that is connecting to the LAN drop in the workspace. Additionally, this workspace could contain a single phone (and possibly desktop VTC endpoint) used by all assignees, and the PC port on it might be the connection for their laptop. In this case, it is best not to use sticky port security but to use a static mapping of authorized devices.\n\nIf this is not a teleworking remote location, this exemption does not apply.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",
