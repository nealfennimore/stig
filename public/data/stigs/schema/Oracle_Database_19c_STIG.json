          "description": "<VulnDiscussion>Database management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions using a database management system (DBMS). Unlimited concurrent connections to the DBMS could allow a successful denial-of-service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; and a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks.\n\nThis requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts; and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts.\n\nThe capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in or added to the DBMS (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. Note that it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to the DBMS by other means.\n\nThe organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, two might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session.\n\n(Sessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the purposes of this requirement are synonyms.)</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. \n\nAccess control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.\n\nThis requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes database management systems. If the DBMS does not follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-APP-000033-DB-000084, SRG-APP-000340-DB-000304</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

Without auditing, a compromise may go undetected and without a means to determine accountability.\n\nThe Department of Defense has established the following as the minimum set of auditable events:\n- When privileges/permissions are retrieved, added, modified or deleted.\n- When unsuccessful attempts to retrieve, add, modify, delete privileges/permissions occur.\n- Enforcement of access restrictions associated with changes to the configuration of the database(s).\n- When security objects are accessed, modified, or deleted.\n- When unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete security objects occur.\n- When categories of information (e.g., classification levels/security levels) are accessed, created, modified, or deleted.\n- When unsuccessful attempts to access, create, modify, or delete categorized information occur.\n- All privileged activities or other system-level access.\n- When unsuccessful attempts to execute privileged activities or other system-level access occurs.\n- When successful or unsuccessful access to any other objects occur as specifically defined by the site.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-APP-000091-DB-000066, SRG-APP-000091-DB-000325, SRG-APP-000492-DB-000333, SRG-APP-000494-DB-000344, SRG-APP-000494-DB-000345, SRG-APP-000495-DB-000326, SRG-APP-000495-DB-000327, SRG-APP-000495-DB-000328, SRG-APP-000495-DB-000329, SRG-APP-000496-DB-000334, SRG-APP-000496-DB-000335, SRG-APP-000498-DB-000346, SRG-APP-000498-DB-000347, SRG-APP-000499-DB-000330, SRG-APP-000499-DB-000331, SRG-APP-000501-DB-000336, SRG-APP-000501-DB-000337, SRG-APP-000502-DB-000348, SRG-APP-000502-DB-000349, SRG-APP-000503-DB-000350, SRG-APP-000503-DB-000351, SRG-APP-000504-DB-000354, SRG-APP-000504-DB-000355, SRG-APP-000505-DB-000352, SRG-APP-000506-DB-000353, SRG-APP-000507-DB-000357, SRG-APP-000508-DB-000358</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

Oracle Audit Vault Server supports data retention policies on a per source basis, making it possible to meet internal or external compliance requirements. To prevent unauthorized access or tampering, Oracle Audit Vault encrypts audit and event data at every stage, in transmission and at rest. For Oracle Databases, Oracle Audit Vault can track changes to data, user entitlements, and stored procedures. Historical tracking of important data attributes allows users to quickly report on the lifecycle of a data attribute. User entitlements tracking enables easy reporting on which users have what privileges, along with differential reporting on what has changed since the last report. Maliciously modified stored procedures are a frequent vector for data theft-stored procedure tracking helps users quickly spot changes.

Oracle Database calculates the total service units as a weighted sum of CPU_PER_SESSION, CONNECT_TIME,\nLOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION, and PRIVATE_SGA.\n\nSESSIONS_PER_USER - Specify the number of concurrent sessions to limit the user to.\n\nCPU_PER_SESSION - Specify the CPU time limit for a session, expressed in hundredths of seconds.\n\nCPU_PER_CALL - Specify the CPU time limit for a call (a parse, execute, or fetch), expressed in hundredths of seconds.\n\nLOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read in a session, including blocks read from memory and disk.\n\nLOGICAL_READS_PER_CALL - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read for a call to process a SQL statement (a parse, execute, or fetch).\n\nPRIVATE_SGA - Specify the amount of private space a session can allocate in the shared pool of the system global area (SGA). Refer to size_clause for information on that clause.\n\nCONNECT_TIME - Specify the total elapsed time limit for a session, expressed in minutes.\n\nIDLE_TIME - Specify the permitted periods of continuous inactive time during a session, expressed in minutes. Long-running queries and other operations are not subject to this limit.\n\nCOMPOSITE_LIMIT - Refer to Oracle documentation for more details.\n\nPassword Parameters: Use the following clauses to set password parameters. Parameters that set lengths of time are interpreted in number of days. For testing purposes, specify minutes (n/1440) or even seconds (n/86400).\n\nFAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS - Specify the number of failed attempts to log on to the user account before the account is locked. If omitting this clause, then the default is 10.\n\nPASSWORD_LIFE_TIME - Specify the number of days the same password can be used for authentication. If setting a value for PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME, then the password expires if it is not changed within the grace period, and further connections are rejected. If omitting this clause, then the default is 180 days.\n\nPASSWORD_REUSE_TIME and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX - These two parameters must be set in conjunction with each other. PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME specifies the number of days before which a password cannot be reused. PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX specifies the number of password changes required before the current password can be reused. For these parameters to have any effect, specify an integer for both of them.\n\nIf specifying a value for both of these parameters, then the user cannot reuse a password until the password has been changed the number of times specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX during the number of days specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME.\n\nFor example, if specifying PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME to 30 and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX to 10, then the user can reuse the password after 30 days if the password has already been changed 10 times.\n\nIf specifying a value for either of these parameters and specify UNLIMITED for the other, then the user can never reuse a password.\n\nIf specifying DEFAULT for either parameter, then Oracle Database uses the value defined in the DEFAULT profile. By default, all parameters are set to UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile. If the default setting of UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile has not changed, then the database treats the value for that parameter as UNLIMITED.\n\nIf setting both of these parameters to UNLIMITED, then the database ignores both of them. This is the default if omitting both parameters.\n\nPASSWORD_LOCK_TIME - Specify the number of days an account will be locked after the specified number of consecutive failed logon attempts. If omitting this clause, then the default is one day.\n\nPASSWORD_GRACE_TIME - Specify the number of days after the grace period begins during which a warning is issued and logon is allowed. If omitting this clause, then the default is seven days.\n\nPASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION – This clause allows a PL/SQL password complexity verification script to be passed as an argument to the CREATE PROFILE statement.

          "description": "<VulnDiscussion>To assure individual accountability and prevent unauthorized access, application users (and any processes acting on behalf of users) must be individually identified and authenticated.\n\nA shared authenticator is a generic account used by multiple individuals. Use of a shared authenticator alone does not uniquely identify individual users. An example of a shared authenticator is the Unix OS \"root\" user account, a Windows \"administrator\" account, a \"SA\" account, or a \"helpdesk\" account.\n\nFor example, the Unix and Windows operating systems offer a \"switch user\" capability allowing users to authenticate with their individual credentials and, when needed, switch to the administrator role. This method provides for unique individual authentication prior to using a shared authenticator.\n\nSome applications may not have the need to provide a group authenticator; this is considered a matter of application design. In those instances where the application design includes the use of a shared authenticator, this requirement will apply.\n\nThere may also be instances when specific user actions need to be performed on the information system without unique user identification or authentication. An example of this type of access is a web server which contains publicly releasable information. These types of accesses are allowed but must be explicitly identified and documented by the organization.\n\nWhen shared accounts are used without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.\n\nOracle Access Manager may be helpful in meeting this requirement.\n\nOracle Access Manager is used when there is a need for multifactor authentication of applications front-ending Oracle Datasets that may use group accounts. Oracle Access Manager supports using PKI-based smart cards (CAC, PIV) for multifactor authentication. When a user authenticates to a smart card application, the smart card engine produces a certificate-based authentication token. Can configure a certificate-based authentication scheme in Oracle Access Manager that uses information from the smart card certificate. Certificate-based authentication works with any smart card or similar device that presents an X.509 certificate.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

If passwords are present, ensure they are correctly hashed using one-way, salted hashing functions, and that the hashes are protected by host system security.\n\nThe following are notes on implementing a Secure External Password Store using Oracle Wallet.\n\nOracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility. Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use, or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function.\n\nCheck to verify what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store.\n\nTo view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information that can be used to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store. To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line:\n\n$ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential\n\nFor example: $ mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\19.0.0\\db_1\\wallets -listCredential\n\nThe wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents is to be viewed, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding username (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed.\n\nConfiguring Clients to Use the External Password Store:\n\nIf the client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows built-in authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log on to the database.\n\nFor clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before.\n\nIf wanting a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task:\n\n1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line:\n\nmkstore -wrl wallet_location -create\n\nFor example: mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\19.0.0\\db_1\\wallets -create\nEnter password: password\n\nThe wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet is to be created and stored. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologon feature enabled at the location specified. The autologon feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password.\n\nThe mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification.\n\n2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line:\n\nmkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username\nEnter password: password\n\nFor example: mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\19.0.0\\db_1\\wallets -createCredential oracle system\nEnter password: password\n\nIn this specification, the wallet_location is the path to the directory where the wallet was created. The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command. The db_connect_string is the TNS alias used to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name used to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on Unix systems and in ORACLE_HOME\\network\\admin on Windows. The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user.\n\n3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet created in Step 1. For example, if the wallet was created in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and Oracle home is set to /private/ora19, then enter the following into client sqlnet.ora file:\n\nWALLET_LOCATION =\n(SOURCE =\n(METHOD = FILE)\n(METHOD_DATA =\n(DIRECTORY = /private/ora19/network/admin)\n)\n)\n\n4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows:\n\nSQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE\n\nThis setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases.\n\nWhen external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a username and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.\n\nBelow is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.\n\nWALLET_LOCATION =\n(SOURCE =\n(METHOD = FILE)\n(METHOD_DATA =\n(DIRECTORY = /private/ora19/network/admin)\n)\n)\nSQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE\nSSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE\nSSL_VERSION = 3.0\n\nNote: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Refer to the following link if using a nondefault configuration:\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/netrf/parameters-for-the-sqlnet.ora.html",

However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail.\n\nBelow is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4.\n\nBelow is a sample SQLNET.ORA File with wallet parameters set.\n\nWALLET_LOCATION =\n(SOURCE =\n(METHOD = FILE)\n(METHOD_DATA =\n(DIRECTORY = /private/ora19/network/admin)\n)\n)\n\nSQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE\nSSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE\nSSL_VERSION = 3.0\n\nNote: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use.

This results in unanticipated application behavior, potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid user input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.\n\nAll applications need to validate the data users attempt to input to the application for processing. Rules for checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, acceptable values) are in place to verify inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Inputs passed to interpreters are prescreened to prevent the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands.\n\nThis requires for inspection of application source code, which will involve collaboration with the application developers.

At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.\n\nOracle provides built-in processes to keep data and its integrity intact by using constraints.\n\nIntegrity Constraint States can specify that a constraint is enabled (ENABLE) or disabled (DISABLE).

If a constraint is disabled, then data that does not conform can be allowed to enter the database.\n\nAdditionally, can specify that existing data in the table must conform to the constraint (VALIDATE).

Check the DDL for the tables that are created for the applications to verify constraints have been enabled.\n\nEnabling Constraints Upon Definition: The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and enable integrity constraints:\nCREATE TABLE emp (\nempno NUMBER(5) CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY, . . . ) ;\nALTER TABLE emp\nADD CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY (empno);\n\nAn ALTER TABLE statement that defines and attempts to enable an integrity constraint can fail because existing rows of the table violate the integrity constraint. In this case, the statement is rolled back, and the constraint definition is not stored and not enabled.\n\nWhen enabling a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint, an associated index is created.  \n\nFor details about the meaning of these states and an understanding of their consequences, refer to the Oracle Database SQL Language Reference. Some of these consequences are discussed here.\n\nDisabling Constraints: To enforce the rules defined by integrity constraints, the constraints should always be enabled. However, consider temporarily disabling the integrity constraints of a table for the following performance reasons:\n\n- When loading large amounts of data into a table;\n\n- When performing batch operations that make massive changes to a table (for example, changing every employee's number by adding 1000 to the existing number); or\n\n- When importing or exporting one table at a time.\n\nIn all three cases, temporarily disabling integrity constraints can improve the performance of the operation, especially in data warehouse configurations.\n\nIt is possible to enter data that violates a constraint while that constraint is disabled. Thus, always enable the constraint after completing any of the operations listed in the preceding bullet list.\n\nEnabling Constraints: While a constraint is enabled, no row violating the constraint can be inserted into the table. However, while the constraint is disabled, such a row can be inserted. This row is known as an exception to the constraint. If the constraint is in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state, violations resulting from data entered while the constraint was disabled remain. The rows that violate the constraint must be either updated or deleted in order for the constraint to be put in the validated state.\n\nCan identify exceptions to a specific integrity constraint while attempting to enable the constraint. Refer to \"Reporting Constraint Exceptions\". All rows violating constraints are noted in an EXCEPTIONS table, which can be examined.\n\nENABLE, NOVALIDATE Constraint State: When a constraint is in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state, all subsequent statements are checked for conformity to the constraint. However, any existing data in the table is not checked. A table with ENABLE, NOVALIDATE constraints can contain invalid data, but it is not possible to add new invalid data to it. Constraints in the ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state is most useful in data warehouse configurations that are uploading valid OLTP data.\n\nEnabling a constraint does not require validation. Enabling a constraint NOVALIDATE is much faster than enabling and validating a constraint. Also, validating a constraint that is already enabled does not require any DML locks during validation (unlike validating a previously disabled constraint). Enforcement guarantees that no violations are introduced during the validation. Hence, enabling without validating reduces the downtime typically associated with enabling a constraint.\n\nEfficient Use of Integrity Constraints: A Procedure:\nUsing integrity constraint states in the following order can ensure the best benefits:\n- Disable state.\n- Perform the operation (load, export, import).\n- ENABLE, NOVALIDATE state.\n- Enable state.\n\nSome benefits of using constraints in this order are:\n- No locks are held.\n- All constraints can go to enable state concurrently.\n- Constraint enabling is done in parallel.\n- Concurrent activity on table is permitted.\n\nSetting Integrity Constraints Upon Definition: When an integrity constraint is defined in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement, it can be enabled, disabled, or validated or not validated as determined by the specification of the ENABLE/DISABLE clause. If the ENABLE/DISABLE clause is not specified in a constraint definition, the database automatically enables and validates the constraint.\n\nDisabling Constraints Upon Definition: The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and disable integrity constraints:\n\nCREATE TABLE emp (\nempno NUMBER(5) PRIMARY KEY DISABLE, . . . ;\n\nALTER TABLE emp\nADD PRIMARY KEY (empno) DISABLE;\n\nAn ALTER TABLE statement that defines and disables an integrity constraint never fails because of rows in the table that violate the integrity constraint. The definition of the constraint is allowed because its rule is not enforced.\n\nEnabling Constraints Upon Definition:\n\nThe following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and enable integrity constraints:\n\nCREATE TABLE emp (\nempno NUMBER(5) CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY, . . . ;\n\nALTER TABLE emp\nADD CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY (empno);\n\nAn ALTER TABLE statement that defines and attempts to enable an integrity constraint can fail because rows of the table violate the integrity constraint.

Use strongly typed data items rather than general purpose strings as input parameters to task-specific, precompiled stored procedures and functions (and triggers).\n\nWhen dynamic execution is necessary, ways to mitigate the risk include the following, which should be implemented both in the on-screen application and at the database level, in the stored procedures:\n- Allow strings as input only when necessary. \n- Rely on data typing to validate numbers, dates, etc. Do not accept invalid values. If substituting other values for them, think carefully about whether this could be subverted.\n- Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary.\n- If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equals signs, angle brackets, or square brackets will never be valid as input, reject them.\n- If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them. In SQL, these are -- or /* */ \n- If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them.\n- If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. In SQL these are the underscore and the percentage sign, and the word ESCAPE is also a clue that wildcards are in use.\n- If SQL key words, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ESCAPE, UNION, GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, MODIFY will never be valid, reject them. Use case-insensitive comparisons when searching for these. Bear in mind that some of these words, particularly Grant (as a person's name), could also be valid input. \n- If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits.\n- Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding, by a party other than the developer.\n- Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use.\n- Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation.\n- Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a web service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways.

The structure and content of error messages need to be carefully considered by the organization and development team.\n\nDatabases can inadvertently provide a wealth of information to an attacker through improperly handled error messages. In addition to sensitive business or personal information, database errors can provide host names, IP addresses, usernames, and other system information not required for troubleshooting but very useful to someone targeting the system.\n\nCarefully consider the structure/content of error messages. The extent to which information systems are able to identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements. Information that could be exploited by adversaries includes, for example, logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as the username, mission/business information that can be derived from (if not stated explicitly by) information recorded, and personal information, such as account numbers, social security numbers, and credit card numbers.\n\nThis requires for inspection of application source code, which will involve collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

The database uses a wallet that is a container that is used to store authentication and signing credentials, including private keys, certificates, and trusted certificates needed by TLS. In an Oracle environment, every entity that communicates over TLS must have a wallet containing an X.509 version 3 certificate, private key, and list of trusted certificates.\n\nIf the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/sqlnet.ora contains the following entries, TLS is installed.\n\nWALLET_LOCATION = (SOURCE=\n(METHOD = FILE) \n(METHOD_DATA = \nDIRECTORY=/wallet) \n\nSSL_CIPHER_SUITES=(SSL_cipher_suiteExample) \nSSL_VERSION = 3.0\nSSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION=TRUE"
