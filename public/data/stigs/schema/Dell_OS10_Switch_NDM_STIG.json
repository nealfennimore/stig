The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information. All DOD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on authentication for authorized access.\n\nAuthorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset or set of resources. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.\n\nSome network devices are preconfigured with security groups. Other network devices enable operators to create custom security groups with custom permissions. For example, an information system security manager (ISSM) may require read-only access to audit the network device. Operators may create an audit security group, define permissions, and access levels for members of the group, and then assign the ISSM's user persona to the audit security group. This is still considered privileged access, but the ISSM's security group is more restrictive than the network administrator's security group.\n\nNetwork devices that rely on AAA brokers for authentication and authorization services may need to identify the available security groups or access levels available on the network devices and convey that information to the AAA operator. Once the AAA broker identifies the user persona on the centralized directory service, the user's security group memberships can be retrieved. The AAA operator may need to create a mapping that links target security groups from the directory service to the appropriate security groups or access levels on the network device. Once these mappings are configured, authorizations can happen dynamically, based on each user's directory service group membership.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

          "description": "<VulnDiscussion>MFA is when two or more factors are used to confirm the identity of an individual who is requesting access to digital information resources. Valid factors include something the individual knows (e.g., username and password), something the individual has (e.g., a smartcard or token), or something the individual is (e.g., a fingerprint or biometric). Legacy information system environments only use a single factor for authentication, typically a username and password combination. Although two pieces of data are used in a username and password combination, this is still considered single factor because an attacker can obtain access simply by learning what the user knows. Common attacks against single-factor authentication are attacks on user passwords. These attacks include brute force password guessing, password spraying, and password credential stuffing. MFA, along with strong user account hygiene, helps mitigate against the threat of having account passwords discovered by an attacker. Even in the event of a password compromise, with MFA implemented and required for interactive login, the attacker still needs to acquire something the user has or replicate a piece of user’s biometric digital presence.\n\nPrivate industry recognizes and uses a wide variety of MFA solutions. However, DOD public key infrastructure (PKI) is the only prescribed method approved for DOD organizations to implement MFA. For authentication purposes, centralized DOD certificate authorities (CA) issue PKI certificate key pairs (public and private) to individuals using the prescribed x.509 format. The private certificates that have been generated by the issuing CA are downloaded and saved to smartcards which, within DOD, are referred to as common access cards (CAC) or personal identity verification (PIV) cards. This happens at designated DOD badge facilities. The CA maintains a record of the corresponding public keys for use with PKI-enabled environments. Privileged user smartcards, or \"alternate tokens\", function in the same manner, so this requirement applies to all interactive user sessions (authorized and privileged users).\n\nNote: This requirement is used in conjunction with the use of a centralized authentication server (e.g., AAA, RADIUS, LDAP), a separate but equally important requirement. The MFA configuration of this requirement provides identification and the first phase of authentication (the challenge and validated response, thereby confirming the PKI certificate that was presented by the user). The centralized authentication server will provide the second phase of authentication (the digital presence of the PKI ID as a valid user in the requested security domain) and authorization. The centralized authentication server will map validated PKI identities to valid user accounts and determine access levels for authenticated users based on security group membership and role. In cases where the centralized authentication server is not used by the network device for user authorization, the network device must map the authenticated identity to the user account for PKI-based authentication.\n\nSatisfies: SRG-APP-000149-NDM-000247, SRG-APP-000820-NDM-000170, SRG-APP-000825-NDM-000180</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

          "description": "<VulnDiscussion>Once issued by a DOD certificate authority (CA), public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates are typically valid for three years or shorter within the DOD. However, there are many reasons a certificate may become invalid before the prescribed expiration date. For example, an employee may leave or be terminated and still possess the smartcard on which the PKI certificates were stored. Another example is that a smartcard containing PKI certificates may become lost or stolen. A more serious issue could be that the CA or server which issued the PKI certificates has become compromised, thereby jeopardizing every certificate keypair that was issued by the CA. These examples of revocation use cases and many more can be researched further using internet cybersecurity resources.\n\nPKI user certificates presented as part of the identification and authentication criteria (e.g., DOD PKI as multifactor authentication [MFA]) must be checked for validity by network devices. For example, valid PKI certificates are digitally signed by a trusted DOD CA. Additionally, valid PKI certificates are not expired, and valid certificates have not been revoked by a DOD CA.\n\nNetwork devices can verify the validity of PKI certificates by checking with an authoritative CA. One method of checking the status of PKI certificates is to query databases referred to as certificate revocation lists (CRL). These are lists which are published, updated, and maintained by authoritative DOD CAs. For example, once certificates are expired or revoked, issuing CAs place the certificates on a certificate revocation list (CRL). Organizations can download these lists periodically (i.e., daily or weekly) and store them locally on the devices themselves or even onto another nearby local enclave resource. Storing them locally ensures revocation status can be checked even if internet connectivity is severed at the enclave’s point of presence (PoP). However, CRLs can be rather large in storage size and further, the use of CRLs can be rather taxing on some computing resources.\n\nAnother method of validating certificate status is to use the online certificate status protocol (OCSP). Using OCSP, a requestor (i.e., the network device to which the user is trying to authenticate) sends a request to an authoritative CA challenging the validity of a certificate that has been presented for identification and authentication. The CA receives the request and sends a digitally signed response indicating the status of the user's certificate as valid, revoked, or unknown. Network devices should only allow access for responses that indicate the certificates presented by the user were considered valid by an approved DOD CA. OCSP is the preferred method because it is fast, provides the most current status, and is lightweight. </VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

A strength of using PKI as multifactor authentication (MFA) is that it can help ensure only the assigned individual is using their associated user account. This can only be accomplished if the network device is configured to enforce the relationship which binds PKI certificates to unique user accounts.\n\nLocal accounts (accounts created, stored, and maintained locally on the network device) should be avoided in lieu of using a centrally managed directory service. Local accounts empower the same workgroup who will be operating the network infrastructure to also control and manipulate access methods, thus creating operational autonomy. This undesirable approach breaks the concept of separation of duties. Additionally, local accounts are susceptible to poor cyber hygiene because they create another user database that must be maintained by the operator, whose primary focus is on running the network. Such examples of poor hygiene include dormant accounts that are not disabled or deleted, employees who have left the organization but whose accounts are still present, periodic password and hash rotation, password complexity shortcomings, increased exposure to insider threat, etc. For reasons such as this, local users on network devices are frequently the targets of cyber-attacks. Instead, organizations should explore examples of centrally managed account services. These examples include the implementation of AAA concepts like the use of external RADIUS and LDAP directory service brokers.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",

Patch criticality, as well as system criticality will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary.

          "description": "<VulnDiscussion>The loss of connectivity to a particular authoritative time source will result in the loss of time synchronization (free-run mode) and increasingly inaccurate time stamps on audit events and other functions. \n\nMultiple time sources provide redundancy by including a secondary source. Time synchronization is usually a hierarchy; clients synchronize time to a local source while that source synchronizes its time to a more accurate source. The network device must use an authoritative time server and/or be configured to use redundant authoritative time sources. This requirement is related to the comparison done in CCI-001891.\n\nDOD-approved solutions consist of a combination of a primary and secondary time source using a combination or multiple instances of the following: a time server designated for the appropriate DOD network (NIPRNet/SIPRNet); United States Naval Observatory (USNO) time servers; and/or the Global Positioning System (GPS). The secondary time source must be in a different geographic region than the primary time source.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",
