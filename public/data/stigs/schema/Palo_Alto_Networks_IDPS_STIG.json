Examples of mobile code include JavaScript, VBScript, Java applets, ActiveX controls, Flash animations, Shockwave videos, and macros embedded within Microsoft Office documents. Mobile code can be exploited to attack a host. It can be sent as an e-mail attachment or embedded in other file formats not traditionally associated with executable code.\n\nWhile the IDPS cannot replace the anti-virus and host-based IDS (HIDS) protection installed on the network's endpoints, vendor or locally created sensor rules can be implemented, which provide preemptive defense against both known and zero-day vulnerabilities. Many of the protections may provide defenses before vulnerabilities are discovered and rules or blacklist updates are distributed by anti-virus or malicious code solution vendors.\n\nThe Palo Alto Networks security platform allows customized profiles to be used to perform antivirus inspection for traffic between zones. Antivirus, anti-spyware, and vulnerability protection features require a specific license. There is a default Antivirus Profile; the profile inspects all of the listed protocol decoders for viruses, and generates alerts for SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 protocols while dropping for FTP, HTTP, and SMB protocols. However, these default actions cannot be edited and the values for the FTP, HTTP, and SMB protocols do not meet the requirement, so customized profiles must be used.</VulnDiscussion><FalsePositives></FalsePositives><FalseNegatives></FalseNegatives><Documentable>false</Documentable><Mitigations></Mitigations><SeverityOverrideGuidance></SeverityOverrideGuidance><PotentialImpacts></PotentialImpacts><ThirdPartyTools></ThirdPartyTools><MitigationControl></MitigationControl><Responsibility></Responsibility><IAControls></IAControls>",
