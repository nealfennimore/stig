          "description": "<VulnDiscussion>Note: Microsoft recommends using the Windows Communication Framework (WCF) rather than using .Net remoting. New development projects should refrain from using .Net remoting capabilities whenever possible.\n\n.NET remoting provides the capability to build widely distributed applications. The application components may reside all on one computer or they may be spread out across the enclave. .NET client applications can make remoting calls to use objects in other processes on the same computer or on any other computer that is reachable over the network. .NET remoting can also be used to communicate with other application domains within the same process. Remoting is achieved via the exposure of endpoints that can be used to establish remote connectivity.\n\nNormally when application code attempts to access a protected resource, a stack walk is performed to ensure that all stack frames have permission to access the resource. However, with .Net 4.0, when a call is made on a remote object, this stack walk is not performed across the remoting boundary. The .Net remoting infrastructure requires FullTrust permission to execute on either the client or the server. \n\nDue to the fact that FullTrust permission is required, Remoting endpoints should be authenticated and encrypted in order to protect the system and the data. \n\nMicrosoft provides three different \"channels\" that are used for remoting. They are HTTP, TCP, and IPC.\n\nAny unauthorized use of a remoting application provides unauthorized access with FullTrust permissions to the system.

This file is located in the %SYSTEMROOT%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\Config directory for 32 bit .NET 4 installations and %SYSTEMROOT%\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\Config for 64 bit systems.   Machine.config contains configuration settings for machine-wide assembly binding, built-in remoting channels, and ASP.NET.\n\nApplication Configuration Files:\nApplication configuration files contain settings specific to an application. If checking these files, a .NET review of a specific .NET application is most likely being conducted. These files contain configuration settings that the Common Language Runtime reads (such as assembly binding policy, remoting objects, and so on), and settings that the application can read. \n\nThe name and location of the application configuration file depends on the application's host, which can be one of the following: \n\nExecutable–hosted application configuration files. \n\nThe configuration file for an application hosted by the executable host is in the same directory as the application. The name of the configuration file is the name of the application with a .config extension. For example, an application called myApp.exe can be associated with a configuration file called myApp.exe.config. \n\nInternet Explorer-hosted application configuration files. \n\nIf an application hosted in Internet Explorer has a configuration file, the location of this file is specified in a <link> tag with the following syntax.\n\n<link rel=\"ConfigurationFileName\" href=\"location\">\n\nIn this tag, \"location\" represents a URL that point to the configuration file. This sets the application base. The configuration file must be located on the same web site as the application. \n\n.NET 4.0 allows the CLR runtime to be configured to ignore FIPS encryption requirements.

Additionally, application developers will utilize \"sandboxing\" techniques within their code in order to isolate 3rd party code libraries from critical system resources.\n\nIn order to assign protections to .Net 4.0 applications, the applications must first be identified and the appropriate hosting security mechanisms configured to accomplish that task.  \n\n.Net STIG guidance cannot be applied if .Net applications are not identified and documented.

New development projects should refrain from using .Net remoting capabilities whenever possible.\n\n.NET remoting provides the capability to build widely distributed applications. The application components may reside all on one computer or they may be spread out across the enclave. .NET client applications can make remoting calls to use objects in other processes on the same computer or on any other computer that is reachable over the network. .NET remoting can also be used to communicate with other application domains within the same process. Remoting is achieved via the exposure of endpoints that can be used to establish remote connectivity.\n\nNormally when application code attempts to access a protected resource, a stack walk is performed to ensure that all stack frames have permission to access the resource. However, with .Net 4.0, when a call is made on a remote object, this stack walk is not performed across the remoting boundary. The .Net remoting infrastructure requires FullTrust permission to execute on either the client or the server. \n\nDue to the fact that FullTrust permission is required, Remoting endpoints should be authenticated and encrypted in order to protect the system and the data. \n\nMicrosoft provides three different \"channels\" that are used for remoting.
